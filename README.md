### 2. Visualize trip distance by time of day in any way you see fit, any observations?

Observations:
A rise in distances covered from midnight till 5 am. We observe long range trips in the morning and evenings. Eventually drops from 5 am to 10 am, but still quite a lot of miles covered between 5 and 10 (could be for people leaving for work, daily chores in the morning etc.). The evening peak are shorter than the morning peak. They eventually see a rise after 8 pm, probably people getting off work, or going for hang outs, dinners, other chores etc. Highest median distance is approx. 2.57 miles. For mean, it is 4.2 miles.
